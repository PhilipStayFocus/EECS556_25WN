## Introduction

This repository is the **official implementation** of the paper, "Deep Fourier Upsampling", where more implementation details are presented.

### 0. class freup_Areadinterpolation()

It corresponds to the implementaion of the Area Interpolation Variant of Deep Fourier Up-sampling

### 1. class freup_AreadinterpolationV2()

It corresponds to the implementaion of the Area Interpolation Variant v2 of Deep Fourier Up-sampling


### 2. class freup_Periodicpadding()

It corresponds to the implementaion of the Periodic padding Variant of Deep Fourier Up-sampling




### 3. class freup_Cornerdinterpolation()

It corresponds to the implementaion of the Corner Interpolation Variant of Deep Fourier Up-sampling
